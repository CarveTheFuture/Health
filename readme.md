Time Spans of Interest

In October 2020,this project was embarked on by OPA Towobola to explore and organize data and analysis on world trends. The main spheres of inqiry were in energy (production, consumption), health (longevity and disease rates) and development (urbanization and GDP). The initial intent was to link these, so as to determine linkages. One question that could be answered is whether urbanization trends are promoting better or worse health. A similar question that could be answered is whether promiximity to energy sources (power lines) is linked to health trends for any demograhic group in particular.
